## Notes on `.rstheme` installation*

To install custom themes in RStudio, you must have the [daily build](https://dailies.rstudio.com/) installed. 

With the daily build, you can import the [tmTheme file](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/tmTheme/night-owlish.tmTheme) by going to `Preferences >> Appearance >> Add` (see gif, below â€” night-owl not actually shown).

However, I've added several improvements specific to the Ace and rstheme formats. In order to modify the imported rstheme file, you'll need to go to:â€ 

- Mac: **`/Users/<you>/.R/rstudio/themes`**. 
- Linux: **`/home/<you>/.R/rstudio/themes`**.

There, you'll find the imported theme as `night-owlish.rstheme`. You can either copy and paste the contents, or the [`night-owlish.rstheme`](https://github.com/batpigandme/night-owlish/blob/master/rstheme/night-owlish.rstheme) file itself (the one in this repo) to enable the super-special-just-for-RStudio-beautified version. ðŸ’…
